# Graph Studio — `graph-ui/`

Graph Studio is the browser-based visual graph editor bundled with Waggle. It is built with **Vite + React + Tailwind CSS** and served locally by `waggle-mcp edit-graph`.

---

## Features

- **Dual-layer view** — switch between graph topology and conversation transcript views
- **Interactive editing** — drag nodes, shift-drag to create edges, click to edit content
- **Retrieval debug** — inspect hybrid retrieval scores, transcript provenance, and node ranking
- **Live stats** — connected nodes, isolate count, cluster summary
- **Export/import** — export the current graph view, preview `.abhi` diffs, and trigger sharing workflows
- **Collapsible panels** — focus mode for dense graphs; label toggle for readability

---

## Quick Start (Development)

```bash
# From the repo root
cd graph-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server starts at `http://localhost:5173`. It expects the Waggle MCP server to be running separately:

```bash
# In another terminal
WAGGLE_MODEL=deterministic waggle-mcp serve --transport http
```

---

## Build for Production

The built assets are bundled into the Python package under `src/waggle/static/graph/`:

```bash
cd graph-ui
npm run build
# Output goes to: ../src/waggle/static/graph/
```

After building, reinstall the package to pick up the new assets:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
