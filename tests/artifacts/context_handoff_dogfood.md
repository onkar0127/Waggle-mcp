## How To Use

Use this as authoritative imported context. Prefer the summary, decisions, contradictions, timeline, and relationship map before consulting the appendix for raw node details.

## Memory Summary

Key context: The comparative benchmark still measures 88% Hit@k and 73% exact support for Waggle on 27 scenarios and 66 queries, despite the extraction improvements.; The deterministic extraction corpus was expanded from 18 to 25 cases and now covers favorite-language phrasing, multi-clause turns, hedged statements, conditio…. Decisions: Hedged or conditional turns such as "I think we should probably go with Redis" are stored as note nodes instead of hard… Supported by Avoid premature commitment; Negated statements such as "We are not using MongoDB anymore" are stored as decision nodes with negated tags so the gra… Supported by Preserve user polarity. Open items: Context handoff dogfood; Query bundle summary improvement.

## Key Facts By Node Type

### Decision
- "Hedged statements policy" (created 2026-04-18, updated 2026-04-18): Hedged or conditional turns such as "I think we should probably go with Redis" are stored as note nodes instead of hard decisions.
- "Negated tool choice policy" (created 2026-04-18, updated 2026-04-18): Negated statements such as "We are not using MongoDB anymore" are stored as decision nodes with negated tags so the graph preserves polarity.

### Fact
- "Current comparative gap" (created 2026-04-18, updated 2026-04-18): The comparative benchmark still measures 88% Hit@k and 73% exact support for Waggle on 27 scenarios and 66 queries, despite the extraction improvements.
- "Extraction corpus expansion" (created 2026-04-18, updated 2026-04-18): The deterministic extraction corpus was expanded from 18 to 25 cases and now covers favorite-language phrasing, multi-clause turns, hedged statements, conditional choices, and negated tool decisions.
- "Avoid premature commitment" (created 2026-04-18, updated 2026-04-18): Tentative language should not be promoted into durable decision memory until it becomes explicit.
- "Preserve user polarity" (created 2026-04-18, updated 2026-04-18): Missing negation would store the opposite of what the user said and silently corrupt the graph.

### Note
- "Context handoff dogfood" (created 2026-04-18, updated 2026-04-18): Context handoff was tested by exporting a bundle from the Waggle project and checking whether another model could continue work without replaying the whole thread.
- "Query bundle summary improvement" (created 2026-04-18, updated 2026-04-18): Query-mode export now synthesizes selected nodes into a useful summary instead of emitting a generic node-and-edge count.
- "LongMemEval methodology note" (created 2026-04-18, updated 2026-04-18): A methodology note explains graph_raw versus graph_hybrid, the cold-versus-warm prepared-session cache, and how the saved artifacts were produced.

## Decisions With Reasons
